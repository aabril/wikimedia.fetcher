## Notes and changelog

```thu 13Feb2020 3:55pm``` 

These are Albert Abril personal notes on the exercise, 
I will be adding extra notes and documentation as the implementation evolves.

#### Rule: no frameworks

As on the readme -> instructions -> Number 5, 
this exercise will be completed without using any framework at all, 
using vanilla javascript and no any ui frontend framework (like react, angular or vue).

#### Rule: separate files & modern browsers => ES6

As on the readme -> instructions -> Number 1, 
this exercise will be expected to work in modern browsers as the latests versions of **Chrome Browser** and **Mozilla Firefox**.

As on the readme -> instructions -> Number 7, 
this exercise will be expected to be organised in different files.

My interpretation is that I will be using ES6 modules (import/export).
Most of the modern browsers support ES6 script modules, except Internet Explorer in 13 Feb 2020.

For now just plain static files.
Perhaps as a #ToDo, a bundler will be included (rollup, parcel, webpack or similar), 
and in this case would be minified and bundled for every modern browser, including Internet Explorer.
