## Task 

Develop a webpage with a form that allows a user to enter a Wikipedia
article name and choose the language version of Wikipedia. 

When the form is submitted, fetch the table of contents of the article 
and display it in hierarchy. 

Clicking on an item in table of contents takes the user to that section in the corresponding Wikipedia article -- in a new browser tab.

An example of the user interface is given below.
